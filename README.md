## t4: Tips, Trick, Tools and Toys

### What Is This?

An informal series of _lightning talks_ taped as videos and supported by
a few slides.  Focused on a few little ticks and tricks, or tools, or toys, to
make computing life just that little bit easier. 

The scope, as outlined in the [initial
post](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2020/05/03#000_introducing_t4) and
[video](https://youtu.be/-gKtibww-fI), is going to be about `bash` and `shell` tricks;
[byobu](https://www.byobu.org/) for session management, multiplexing and more;
[emacs](https://xkcd.com/378/) for life and everything (including
[ESS](https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS), [magit](https://github.com/magit/magit), daemon
mode and more); likely some `git` and probably some `R` possibly via `r`.
